Tank Wars Client Project made by Nicholas Vaskelis and Sam Peters for CS3500 November 2020.


===================================
Welcome to Bootleg Tank Wars Client
===================================

Here is what you need to get started:

======
The UI
======

Top Panel:
- You should see two interactable boxes, one called "Name" and one called "Host".
- You may put a name of up to 16 characters in the "Name" box.
- You may put a website URL or IP Address into the "Host" box with no length restriction.
- Once you have a name entered with a valid host name, you will connect to the server and the game will be displayed on the panel below.
- If the host name is invalid, you will have to relaunch the application and enter in a proper host name.

Game Panel:
- The game is played in this panel. All mouse interactions must be done in this panel.
- If the server goes down when playing, the game will freeze, indicating a disconnect. You can exit out of the application safely if this happens.


========
Controls
========

Movement:
- W to move up.
- S to move down.
- A to move left.
- D to move right.

Shooting:
- Left Mouse Button to fire normal attack.
- Right Mouse Button to fire special attack.

Aiming:
- Move mouse on Game Panel to aim your tank.

============
Game Objects
============
- The red dots on the map are the laser power-up.
- Once you have one, press RMB to fire it.

============
Other Things
============
- We used some of the given assets for tanks, projectiles, and walls. The animations (beam and death) are both hand-made.
- Connection errors will not crash the game, however they will cause it to hang, meaning that you have to restart the application in order to continue using it.
